Component
---------

    - React application is collabration of Components.

    - As a React Developer, we can create more than one Component.

    - As a React Developer, we can provide communication between one component to another component.

    - React supports two types of components

            1) Functional Level Component    (stateless component)

            2) class level component         (statefull component)


Functional Components
---------------------

    - simple "function" behaves like component.

    - "React" is the predefined "class" provides the "component" environment.

**********************************************
demo-app
       src
         First.tsx

         index.tsx
*********************************************

Props
-----
    - "props" is the predefined object in react library.

    - "props" objet used to receive the data from parent component.

*********************************************
props-app
       src
         ParentComp.tsx
         ChildComp.tsx        (props object)
        
         index.tsx
*********************************************


state
-----
    - state is the predefined object in "ReactJS".

    - state used to "store" the component data.

    - we will define state by using "useState()" function

    - useState() called as hook.


*********************************************************

        src
          State.tsx

          index.tsx

                                                ****** State Management ******

        - we can implement state Management applications by using "redux" library.

1) store

        - main application container called as store.

        - store accomidates the initialstate, reducer, state.


2) initialstate

        - application default value called as initialstate.


3) reducer

        - business logic called as reducer.

        - we must deploy reducer to store.


4) state

        - application(reducer) output called as state.

5) dispatch

        - requesting the store called as dispatch.

        - dispatch containes actions... and values.....

6) action

        - application requirement called as action.


7) values/payload

        - application(reducer) input data called as payload


8) subscribe

        - receiving response from store to client called as subscribe.
